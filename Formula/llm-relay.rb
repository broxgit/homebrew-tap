  def install
    # relay.sh finds the skills it installs beside itself, so they stay together.
    libexec.install "relay.sh", "cowork", "claude"
    bin.install_symlink libexec/"relay.sh" => "relay"
    generate_completions_from_executable(bin/"relay", "completion", shells: [:bash, :zsh])

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Run this to begin, and again after each upgrade, so Copilot Cowork gets the skills:
        relay start
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "relay #{version}", shell_output("#{bin}/relay --version")
    assert_match "relay setup", shell_output("#{bin}/relay --help")
  end
end
